# Workplan for the week of 5/5-5/11

### For this week we are setting up our users stories, defining tasks, and breaking them down before jumping into coding

*Initial 5/7 writeup*

The groups we have defined for our user stories are as follows:
1. Small Children
2. Students
3. Adults
4. Family
5. Elderly
6. Disabled Users

We are working on users stories to be shared and asses on 5/8 in a meeting as a group. After we assess the user stories, we will breakdown the stories into executable tasks. The tasks will be given to 3 groups of 3 to implement in a pair programesque manner. 

We currently do not have a sprint schedule at this time. However, we continue to meet Wednesday's after class, and Sunday's at 5pm.

The current tasks to be done will be fully assessed after the user stories, but will most likely include the following:
1. Creation of our own custom map
   - This will include animal exhibits, show areas, and disabled access locations
   - Nodes and locations / routes will be assessed between exhibits
2. Creating a new an impoved UI
    - this will need to incorporate the new map feature and clean up the old buttons
    - Use the current node system to test until the new one is implemented
3. Creating New JSON entries
    - Overhaul backend to include new node types, and new information

Challenges still to be met as a group:
1. Assign into teams
2. Break down tasks to fundamental compenets
3. Prioritize tasks
4. Give the tasks qualitive measurements
